This is a test file.
The question is ... will it work as anticipated.

I want to make a text file and push it to a github repo

then edit the file in github and pull it

let's see

made the file
now saving it

now opening the github package and toggling the git tab on

press "create repository" in the tab.


that seemed to be ok -- except that it did not commit to master

let's try that again
